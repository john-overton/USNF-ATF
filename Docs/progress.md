# Progress

Running status of the build against `build-plan.md`. Updated 2026-09-08.
Newest entry first. Each entry says what is done, what is verified, and
exactly where any in-progress work stopped so it can be picked up cold.

## 2026-09-08: phase 1 complete, phase 0 nearly complete

### Summary

| Phase | Status | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| Repo hygiene | done | `46074cf` |
| 1. Scaffold, shell, packaging | done on Mac; Linux baseline pending | `3be679f` |
| 0. Containers (EALIB, ESA, DCL) | done | `c83967a` |
| 0. PAL, PIC, FNT to PNG | done | `77762b1` |
| 0. PT, JT, OT, NT, T2, M, MT | done (T2 and M partial) | `3e770d0` |
| 0. SH shapes to OBJ | **in progress, uncommitted** | see below |
| 0. CLI integration and baseline | not started | |

Phase 0's exit criteria: `.PT` thrust, mass, and an aero coefficient are
identified with confidence (met). F-14 OBJ recognizable in a viewer (not
yet met; see the SH section).

### Phase 1: scaffold (done)

Bun workspaces (`engine`, `shell`, `importer`), strict TypeScript, ESLint 9,
Prettier, Vite, React 19, Three.js, Electron 44. Main and preload are
bundled with `Bun.build`; the engine never imports `electron`. Platform
interface in `engine/src/platform/Platform.ts` with browser and Electron
implementations. `FixedStepClock` (120 Hz accumulator) is unit-tested.

Scripts: `bun run check` (typecheck, lint, format check, tests),
`bun run dev`, `bun run dev:electron`, `bun run build` (products land in
`build/`), `bun run probe` (launches the app with `--probe`, prints the
WebGL2 capability JSON, exit 0 hardware / 2 software / 3 timeout).

Verified on the Mac: `bun run check` clean with 12 tests; `bun run build`
produced arm64 and x64 dmg and zip under `build/mac/` in about 49 s; the
probe reports the Apple M3 through ANGLE Metal, not a software renderer.
Details in `Docs/baselines/phase-1.md`. The Linux GPU box section of that
baseline is empty until that machine exists.

### Phase 0: containers (done)

`tools/retail/retail/{dcl,ealib,esa,disc}.py`, CLI `python3 -m retail
{list,extract,cat,stats}`. The flag-4 LIB codec is PKWare DCL implode
(port of zlib's `blast.c`). Every compressed entry on both discs decodes to
its declared size: 8,413 LIB entries and 27 ESA entries, zero failures.
Both discs are extracted to `extracted/usnf97/` and `extracted/atf-gold/`
(gitignored, 1.5 GB). Notes: `Docs/formats/{ealib,esa,dcl}.md`.

Quirks recorded: EALIB directories end in a sentinel entry; `USNF_2.LIB`
lists 52 `.XMI` files twice; the earlier ESA off-by-one was the NUL after
the codec tag.

### Phase 0: images, palette, fonts (done)

`retail/{pal,pic,fnt,png}.py`. PIC is a 64-byte header followed by raw
rows or a span-list sprite, optionally with an embedded 6-bit palette that
overlays hardware slots from index 0. All 4,140 PIC files across both
titles decode. FNT files are Phar Lap PE images with one compiled x86
routine per glyph; a small interpreter recovers the bitmaps, 24 of 24
render. The F-14 canopy frame (`~F14H.PIC`, 1280x490) and HUD fonts were
checked by eye. PNGs are under `extracted/png/` (gitignored).

Open: runtime palette ranges 192..254 (sky and some flight sprites) come
from a source not yet located; whether index 255 in `_*.PIC` textures is a
key colour waits on SH texturing.

### Phase 0: plane types, weapons, terrain, missions (done, some partial)

`retail/{brf,pt,jt,t2,mission}.py`. `.PT`, `.JT`, `.OT`, `.NT` are CRLF
text in an assembler-like data language; ATF Gold's copies carry the
original C field names as trailing comments, and USNF'97's are the same
statement sequence without comments, so names transfer by position. `.M`
and `.MT` are plain text. `.HUD` and `.PTS` are small Win32 PE plug-ins.

Identified with evidence: `weight` (F-14 40,104 lb, Jane's empty weight),
`maxTakeoffWeight` (74,349 lb), `thrust` and `aftThrust` (41,800 lbf, two
TF30s in afterburner), `internalFuel`, drag and lift coefficients in 8.8
fixed point, and per-G flight envelope polygons in ft/s and ft. Angles are
1/65536 of a turn. Notes: `Docs/formats/{pt,jt,t2,mission,object-types}.md`.

Theater census (missions referencing each map): Ukraine 103, Kuril 41,
North Vietnam 36 in USNF'97; Vladivostok 58, Egypt 51, Baltics 50, France
25 in ATF Gold. T2 grids are 25x25 to 32x32 tiles of 8x8 cells, 8,192
world units (ft) per cell, so a theater is roughly 500 to 640 km on a side.

**Phase 2 recommendation, not yet decided:** start with Ukraine (most
missions, 77% land) rather than the plan's Kuril default (95% sea).

Open: T2 elevation byte units and tile table, Baltic sea encoding, JT
timer units, PT `structure` and `systemDamage` semantics.

### Phase 0: SH shapes (in progress, stopped by a spend limit)

State: `tools/retail/retail/sh.py` exists (473 lines) and is **untracked**.
`Docs/formats/sh.md` was **never written**, although the module docstring
references it. No tests. The agent's last stated intent was to remove a
superseded idiom-based x86 decoder from the module, save its opcode survey
as a reusable script, and re-run it.

What the module does: treats a `.SH` as a tiny PE image (`MZ` stub, `PL`
signature, `CODE`, optional `.idata` importing `do_start_interp` and
`_nightHazing` from `main.dll`, `.reloc`). The CODE section is a
byte-oriented drawing program: vertex tables (opcode `0x82`, int16 XYZ),
BSP-style plane tests with relative jumps, polygon, line, and point
primitives with palette colours, normals, and optional UVs, plus short x86
stubs that branch on engine state (gear, wing sweep) before re-entering
the interpreter. The parser walks the program as a control-flow graph,
following every branch, and collects the geometry it understands.

Measured on 2026-09-08 (`python3 -m retail.sh --all
extracted/usnf97/USNF_2.LIB -o extracted/obj/usnf97`, exit 0):

| Measure | Value |
|---|---|
| Shapes fully walked with polygons | 316 of 353 |
| Shapes walked with zero polygons | 35 (effects, trees, buildings, clouds, weapons) |
| Shapes that hit an unknown opcode | 2 (`F8.SH` opcode `0x6e`, `SUN.SH` opcode `0x13`) |
| `F14.SH` | 34 vertex tables, 533 vertices, 105 polygons, no stops |
| `F14.obj` as written | 533 vertices, **8 faces** |
| F-14 vertex bounds | x -91..93, y -15..29, z -86..113 (model units) |

The bounds are aircraft-shaped (wide in x and z, thin in y), so vertex
decoding looks right. The gap is between the 105 polygons the parser
reports and the 8 faces `to_obj` emits; likely the OBJ writer only
resolves faces against one vertex table or drops polygons whose indices
refer to tables other than the current one. Until that is fixed the
exit criterion (recognizable F-14 in a viewer) is not met and no preview
image has been rendered.

The 35 zero-polygon shapes are probably billboard sprites and particle
emitters that use primitives the walker does not yet classify, not
parse failures.

To resume: read `sh.py`'s `_Walker` and `to_obj`; fix face emission
across tables; render an orthographic wireframe of `F14.obj` and look at
it; write `Docs/formats/sh.md`; add `tests/test_sh.py`; then commit. Time
box from the plan: if this is not done within two weeks of 2026-09-08,
phase 5 uses a placeholder model.

### Not started

- Integrate `pic`, `fnt`, `sh`, `pt`, `jt`, `t2`, `mission` as
  subcommands of `python3 -m retail` (each currently runs as its own
  module, `python3 -m retail.pic ...`).
- `Docs/baselines/phase-0.md`: decode counts and timings above, recorded
  with machine and commit.
- Decide the first theater (Ukraine recommended) and record it in
  `build-plan.md` section 4.
- Phase 1 exit on the Linux GPU box.

### Repo state

Working tree after this entry: one untracked file, `tools/retail/retail/sh.py`.
Nothing under `extracted/`, `gameassets/`, or `build/` is tracked.
Nothing has been pushed.
